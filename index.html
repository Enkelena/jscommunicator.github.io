                 Deciding to work on a Wordpress Plugin it was a challenge for me since it was something I never
                 worked on before. However that's what HACKATHON is to do something new, and I think at the end together with
                 the group we achieved the goal.

                </p>
                <p class="mx-auto">We first started creating an empty WP plugin and later installed the JS-Communicator in it.</p>
                <p class="mx-auto">
                    JSCommunicator is a WebRTC communication tool developed in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It supports
                    voice, video and chats messaging using the SIP protocol over WebSockets.

                </p>
                <p class="mx-auto">We did add a little colours to the design of the JS communicator and make it look more beautiful!</p>
                <p class="mx-auto"> In the end we could make calls and video calls from Wordpress to other platforms.</p>

                   All of us are studying Computer science. </p>
               <p>We called ourselves Codebreakers because in most of the time on Hackathon our code didn't work. But finally we made it work.</p>
               <p>We had a purpose to learn and make the most out of Hackathon! We faced a lot of challenges but with the help of mentors we have overcome them.</p>
               <p>Thank you CoderGals!</p>
